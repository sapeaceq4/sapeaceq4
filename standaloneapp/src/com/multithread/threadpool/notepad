ThreadPool - 
Thread needs to be create in advance in thread poll to save time and memory.
Thread pool is a collection of threads which you keep alive and use or reuse to process incoming task.
when a new task arrives and a typical example would be a request to an HTTP server then u tried to find thread from the collection
which is idle and handle the task to it.
if no such threads exist u either wait for a become available or add a new thread to the pool
and usually there is an upper limit to the count though.
after the thread has finish the processing the task it is not terminated but only mark the idle 
and ready to be used for any other task.
