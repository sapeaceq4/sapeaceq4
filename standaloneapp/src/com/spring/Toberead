Spring Bean scopes.

Spring’s concept of a singleton bean differs from the Singleton pattern as defined in the Gang of Four (GoF) patterns book. 
The GoF Singleton hard-codes the scope of an object such that one and only one instance of a particular class is created per ClassLoader. 
The scope of the Spring singleton is best described as per container and per bean. 
This means that if you define one bean for a particular class in a single Spring container, 
then the Spring container creates one and only one instance of the class defined by that bean definition. 
The singleton scope is the default scope in Spring. To define a bean as a singleton in XML, you would write, for example:

As a rule, use the prototype scope for all stateful beans and the singleton scope for stateless beans.
