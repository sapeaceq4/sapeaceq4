Strategy design pattern example - behavioral design pattern :
Collections.sort() method that takes Comparator parameter. 
Based on the different implementations of Comparator interfaces, the Objects are getting sorted in different ways.

Strategy pattern is used when we have multiple algorithm for a specific task 
and client decides the actual implementation to be used at runtime.
