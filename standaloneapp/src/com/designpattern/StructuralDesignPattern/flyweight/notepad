To apply flyweight pattern, we need to divide Object property into intrinsic and extrinsic properties.
Intrinsic properties make the Object unique whereas extrinsic properties are set by client code and used to perform different operations.
For example, an Object Circle can have extrinsic properties such as color and width.

Intrinsic [Intrinsic states are things that are constant and are stored in the memory]
Extrinsic [Extrinsic states are things that are not constant and needs to be calculated on fly, 
and are therefore not stored in the memory]
